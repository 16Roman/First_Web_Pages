            <h2> Why should I cut my dogs nails?</h2>
            <p> Not cutting your dog's nails can lead to them developing arthritus. Dog's nails grow in a curved shape, so if they are not trimmed, the claws will eventually start to dig into the dog's skin. </p>
            <p>Longer nails are also much more likely to snag onto fabrics, which can lead to the nail breaking, which leaves the nail susceptible to infections.</p>
