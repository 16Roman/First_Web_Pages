                <h6>Why it's great</h6>
                    <p>
                        Apple is one of the word's largest and most successful companies, and their website represents their products' identity of great design and seamlessly operating without a problem.
                        If you are looking to buy a certain product, you are greeted with the name of every product apple sells from the homepage. You just have to click
                        one to see all avaliable models of the product you desire. If you scroll down you will see the website is divided into boxes that contract each other.
                        Each product within the boxes are distinct from each other and do not blend together at a glance. The website is simple yet effective at showing cusotmers 
                        what products apple has at a glance, and where you can go to purchase those products.

            <h2> An Example of Poor Web Design </h2> <h3><a href=https://www.yahoo.com> Yahoo.com ></a></h3>
            <img src="Yahoo.png" alt="yahoo logo" />
                <h6>Why it's Bad</h6>
                    <p>
                        I believe if people are overwhelmed by the amount of text and images on a website, they will not read any of it. Whoever designed Yahoo's website seems to be afraid
                        of white space, since there is so much on the screen all at once. It's a mixture of text, images, and flashing advertisements that surely distracts and confuses many 
                        Yahoo users.
