                    <p>It is important to make sure images and text still appear as intended, even if the user is viewing the website on a smaller screen</p>
                    <p>Some tools you can use to make your website more responsive include:</p>
                        <ul><li>%</li><li>rem</li></ul>
                    <p>The "%" make the image or text take up a certain percentage of the page. This makes it so no matter the size of the webpage, the picture will take up the same amount of space.</p>
                    <p>The "rem" dictates an element's font size relative to the size of the root element. It can be easily doubled with "2rm"</p>
