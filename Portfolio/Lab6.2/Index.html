                    <p>The most popular operating systems in the world are Apple's iOS and Google's Android.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Android operating system's strength
                        is it's versatility, being able to be used on a wide selection of phones. Apple's iOS will be contained to only Apple's iphone 
                        and it is likely to stay that way forever.

                    <p>People's prefered way of searching the web has slowly shifted from desktops to mobile. In 2013, the majority of web traffic (82.98%) 
                        was coming from desktops. However, in November 2016, mobile web traffic surpassed desktop for the first time, with 50.7% of overall 
                        internet traffic coming from mobile phones and 49.3% from desktops.</p>
                    <p>As of May 2023, 67.81% of total web visits in the US are from mobile devices, while 32.19% come from desktops. The two platforms have 
                        been trading places over the past few years, with neither firmly establishing itself as the dominant web browsing device.</p>
